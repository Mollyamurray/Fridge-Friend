PROJECT TITLE: Fridge Friend    
PURPOSE OF PROJECT: Organize food and expiration dates
VERSION or DATE: 12/14/15
HOW TO START THIS PROJECT: Run the void in the FridgeFriend Class.
AUTHORS: Molly Murray
USER INSTRUCTIONS: Once you run Fridge Friend, it will prompt you to enter in your name. If you're
an authorized user, it'll let you into the "Fridge". So in oder to run it, use Molly as the user. Once there, you can enter in a food
item and its expiration date. From there, it will tell you if it's expired or how many
days left it has until it expires. Once you exit the fridge, it will remember what is in it.
If you go back into the fridge, it will immediately greet you and tell you the name of
your foods in the fridge and how many days until they go bad. You can also remove a food
item and it will be taken out of the fridge permanently. The fridge friend keeps track of all your food 
separate from the other people in the fridge!

The program won't run unless you are an authorized user. That has to be set up
before hand. If you enter in a date in an incorrect format, it might tell you
the food is already expired because it didn't understand the date. 

I did do the extra credit. Link to github will be submitted in the dropbox with the project.
